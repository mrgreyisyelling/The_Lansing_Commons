# The Lansing Commons

Hello - My name is Michael Penta.

This is late coming to the field because I was busy.

Its very simple

Once a week The Lansing Commons is published. 

This is where it is published before it is pushed to another location for the week. 

The version you see here is 'last weeks' version.

Why do this?

It gives everyone very quick and easy access to the files. Until I develop a better way to distribute things, I want to make sure its simple first.

Plus it provides some functionality that the direct file serve doesn't provide. 

Right now its an easy place to put the things I want to work on.

- I need to get the website hosted 
	-I am going to use github pages
	- Create the entry file for your site. GitHub Pages will look for an `index.html`, `index.md`, or `README.md` file as the entry file for your site.

So we need to change that code so that it produces a index.html and that the file is pushed to the github repo
